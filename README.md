The goal of this project is to thoroughly explain the data science pipeline and what to learn from it. In this tutorial, we explore the entire data science pipeline through the lens of the evergrowing field of sports analytics, specifically analyzing the 2023-2024 NBA (National Basketball Association) regular season. Our goal is to use data from the past season and machine learning (ML) techniques to predict the winning percentage of each team for the upcoming 2024-2025 season.

These predictions provide a lot of value for both fans of the teams and the teams themselves. Team predictions are used to aid the teams to plan for what moves to make in the offseason and how to plan for the year overall. It is used not only to measure a team's success, but to additionally measure the impact and interest the team can draw from fans. Ultimately, understanding and projecting team trajectories helps to shape the narrative of the league, providing a roadmap for both short-term dynamics and long-term developments in the NBA.

Additionally with the recent explosion of sports gambling, the value of team predictions and their ability to perform has increased exponentially.

The steps we will follow include:
Data Collection
Data Processing
Exploratory Analysis & Data Visualization
Model: Analysis, Hypothesis Testing, & ML
Interpretation: Insight & Policy Decision
Each season there are countless projects and analysis done attempting to predict all aspects of the NBA season, including awards, the champion, and each team's performance. Our analysis looks to apply our own machine learning technqiues and unique data from this season to perform analysis on team success. This is a good example from a past season done by the Statistics department at the University of California at Berkeley: .

This project handles a variety of team data gathered as a cummulative result of the 2023-2024 NBA season. The data includes standings, offensive and defensive performance, and overall efficiency. An NBA team's success can be subjective, but we will be calculating projected win percentage (out of the usual 82 game season), and how each team would compare in the end of year standings.

It is important to note that many teams will add, remove, and trade players during the NBA offseason during the summer. This analysis is used with the rosters NBA teams have currently, but many teams might have significant roster changes by the start of next season that can impact their predicted performance. This analysis is given the rosters that each team has currenlty, which can be used by teams and fans to understand what moves the team should make. Throughout this tutorial we find many strengths and weaknesses that NBA teams could focus on improving on, as well as other statistics that could demonstrate what moves the team should make to improve their predicted win percentage for the upcoming 2024-2025 NBA season.
